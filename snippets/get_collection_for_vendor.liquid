Given a vendor already assigned to the vendor variable, this sets a collection
variable matched to that vendor.

I suspect/hope there's a better way to do this, but until I know one I'll
encapsulate the awful in here.  This is adapted from collection_designers (and
should probably take over for that code eventually).

AGH I think this is it:

See link_to_vendor.  There's a magical collection that can be referred to as
vendors?q=<vendor>
...but maybe that's problematic if you want more control like custom product
ordering.  Needs more investigating.
