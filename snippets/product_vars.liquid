These image sizes are just fallbacks; we primarily use srcset
and sizes to provide a range of image sizes.

The money_without_trailing_zeros filter should follow the shop's "HTML with
currency" setting, according to Shopify's money filters documentation:
https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/filters/money-filters
But in practice, it looks to me like it's following the "HTML without
currency."  But, in the live site we have the currency typed into the "HTML
without currency" field in the store settings, which is definitely wrong either
way.
So for now, we'll do a manual filter to remove the currency after removing
trailing zeros to force it no matter what.  In the long run we can fix the
store setting to make more sense and confirm with shopify just what that filter
should be doing anyway.
