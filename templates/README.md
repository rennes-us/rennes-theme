 * `page.liquid`, `page.alt.liquid`: Article tags around page content, with
   class "page" and an additional class automatically added for alternate
   pages. "[contact](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/customization/forms/add-contact-form)"
   is a special case required for standard shopify themes, though in this case
   there's no boilerplate contact form built in.
